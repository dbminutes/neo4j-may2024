### Detailed Tutorial on Relationships in Neo4j

In Neo4j, relationships are a fundamental part of the graph model. They connect nodes and define how data in the graph is related. Relationships are directed, meaning they have a start and an end node, and they can have properties, similar to nodes.

### Types of Relationships in Neo4j

While Neo4j doesn't have predefined types of relationships, you can create and name relationships based on the domain model of your application. Relationships are defined by their type, which is a label you assign. Here are common relationship types and how they might be used in the Northwind database:

1. **PLACED**: Represents an order placed by a customer.
2. **CONTAINS**: Represents a product contained in an order.
3. **WORKS_FOR**: Represents an employee working for a company.
4. **SUPPLIES**: Represents a supplier supplying a product.
5. **HANDLED_BY**: Represents an order handled by an employee.

### Creating Relationships

#### Syntax for Creating Relationships

To create a relationship, you use the `CREATE` clause. The basic syntax is:

```cypher
CREATE (startNode)-[relationshipType:RELATIONSHIP_TYPE]->(endNode)
```

#### Example: Creating Relationships in the Northwind Database

1. **Creating a Customer and an Order Relationship**

```cypher
MATCH (c:Customer {customerID: 'ALFKI'}), (o:Order {orderID: 10248})
CREATE (c)-[:PLACED]->(o)
```

2. **Creating an Order and Product Relationship**

```cypher
MATCH (o:Order {orderID: 10248}), (p:Product {productID: 1})
CREATE (o)-[:CONTAINS]->(p)
```

3. **Creating an Employee and Department Relationship**

```cypher
MATCH (e:Employee {employeeID: 1}), (d:Department {name: 'Sales'})
CREATE (e)-[:WORKS_IN]->(d)
```

4. **Creating a Supplier and Product Relationship**

```cypher
MATCH (s:Supplier {supplierID: 1}), (p:Product {productID: 1})
CREATE (s)-[:SUPPLIES]->(p)
```

5. **Creating an Order and Employee Relationship**

```cypher
MATCH (o:Order {orderID: 10248}), (e:Employee {employeeID: 1})
CREATE (o)-[:HANDLED_BY]->(e)
```

### Fetching Data Based on Relationships

#### Syntax for Fetching Data

To fetch data based on relationships, you use the `MATCH` clause. The basic syntax is:

```cypher
MATCH (startNode)-[relationshipType:RELATIONSHIP_TYPE]->(endNode)
RETURN startNode, relationshipType, endNode
```

#### Example: Fetching Data in the Northwind Database

1. **Fetching Customers and Their Orders**

```cypher
MATCH (c:Customer)-[:PLACED]->(o:Order)
RETURN c.customerID, o.orderID, o.orderDate
```

2. **Fetching Orders and the Products They Contain**

```cypher
MATCH (o:Order)-[:CONTAINS]->(p:Product)
RETURN o.orderID, p.productName, p.price
```

3. **Fetching Employees and Their Departments**

```cypher
MATCH (e:Employee)-[:WORKS_IN]->(d:Department)
RETURN e.lastName, d.name
```

4. **Fetching Suppliers and the Products They Supply**

```cypher
MATCH (s:Supplier)-[:SUPPLIES]->(p:Product)
RETURN s.companyName, p.productName
```

5. **Fetching Orders and the Employees Who Handled Them**

```cypher
MATCH (o:Order)-[:HANDLED_BY]->(e:Employee)
RETURN o.orderID, e.lastName
```

### Advanced Queries with Relationships

#### Using `WITH` for Aggregation and Filtering

1. **Find Customers Who Have Placed More Than One Order**

```cypher
MATCH (c:Customer)-[:PLACED]->(o:Order)
WITH c, count(o) AS orderCount
WHERE orderCount > 1
RETURN c.customerID, orderCount
```

2. **Find the Top 5 Products by Number of Orders**

```cypher
MATCH (p:Product)<-[:CONTAINS]-(o:Order)
WITH p, count(o) AS orderCount
ORDER BY orderCount DESC
LIMIT 5
RETURN p.productName, orderCount
```

3. **Find Employees Who Work in the Sales Department and Their Orders**

```cypher
MATCH (e:Employee)-[:WORKS_IN]->(d:Department {name: 'Sales'})
WITH e
MATCH (e)-[:HANDLED_BY]->(o:Order)
RETURN e.lastName, o.orderID
```

#### Pattern Matching for Complex Queries

1. **Find Customers and Products They Ordered**

```cypher
MATCH (c:Customer)-[:PLACED]->(o:Order)-[:CONTAINS]->(p:Product)
RETURN c.customerID, p.productName
```

2. **Find Products and Their Suppliers**

```cypher
MATCH (p:Product)<-[:SUPPLIES]-(s:Supplier)
RETURN p.productName, s.companyName
```
