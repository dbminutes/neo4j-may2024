### Basic Query Techniques in Cypher for Clean and Optimized Code

To write clean and optimized Cypher queries, itâ€™s essential to use best practices and techniques that enhance readability, maintainability, and performance. 

### 1. Use Proper Indexes

Indexes can significantly speed up queries. Create indexes on properties that are frequently used in `MATCH` or `WHERE` clauses.

**Example**: Create an index on `customerID` for the `Customer` nodes.
```cypher
CREATE INDEX FOR (c:Customer) ON (c.customerID)
```

### 2. Use Parameters

Parameters help in writing reusable and safe queries by separating the query logic from the data.

**Example**: Find a customer by `customerID` using a parameter.
```cypher
:param customerID => 'ALFKI';

MATCH (c:Customer {customerID: $customerID})
RETURN c
```

### 3. Limit the Scope of Matches

Limit the amount of data processed by the query to avoid unnecessary computations.

**Example**: Find the first 10 customers from Germany.
```cypher
MATCH (c:Customer {country: 'Germany'})
RETURN c
LIMIT 10
```

### 4. Use `WITH` for Intermediate Results

The `WITH` clause allows you to chain multiple parts of a query together and handle intermediate results.

**Example**: Find customers and their orders, but only return orders placed after January 1, 2021.
```cypher
MATCH (c:Customer)-[:PLACED]->(o:Order)
WHERE o.orderDate > date('2021-01-01')
WITH c, o
RETURN c.contactName, o.orderID, o.orderDate
```

### 5. Filter Early

Apply filters as early as possible in the query to reduce the amount of data processed in subsequent steps.

**Example**: Find employees in the "Sales" department and return their last names.
```cypher
MATCH (e:Employee)-[:WORKS_IN]->(d:Department {name: 'Sales'})
RETURN e.lastName
```

### 6. Use List Comprehensions

List comprehensions can simplify the processing and filtering of collections.

**Example**: Get the names of products that contain "Chai".
```cypher
MATCH (p:Product)
WHERE p.productName CONTAINS 'Chai'
RETURN collect(p.productName) AS chaiProducts
```

### 7. Avoid Cartesian Products

Cartesian products (cross joins) can lead to inefficient queries. Use `WITH` to segment query parts and avoid unintended cross joins.

**Example**: Find customers and their orders without producing a Cartesian product.
```cypher
MATCH (c:Customer)
WITH c
MATCH (c)-[:PLACED]->(o:Order)
RETURN c.customerID, o.orderID
```

### 8. Use Pattern Comprehensions

Pattern comprehensions allow you to return a list of results from a subquery pattern within a single query.

**Example**: Find customers and a list of their order IDs.
```cypher
MATCH (c:Customer)
RETURN c.customerID, [(c)-[:PLACED]->(o:Order) | o.orderID] AS orders
```

### 9. Aggregate Functions

Use aggregate functions to summarize data efficiently.

**Example**: Count the number of orders placed by each customer.
```cypher
MATCH (c:Customer)-[:PLACED]->(o:Order)
RETURN c.customerID, count(o) AS numberOfOrders
```

### 10. Profile and Explain

Use `PROFILE` and `EXPLAIN` to analyze the performance of your queries.

**Example**: Profile a query to see its execution plan.
```cypher
PROFILE
MATCH (c:Customer {country: 'Germany'})
RETURN c
```

#### Example 1: Find Customers with Orders Placed After a Certain Date

```cypher
:param orderDate => '2021-01-01';

MATCH (c:Customer)-[:PLACED]->(o:Order)
WHERE o.orderDate > date($orderDate)
RETURN c.contactName, o.orderID, o.orderDate
```

#### Example 2: Find Top 5 Products by Number of Orders

```cypher
MATCH (p:Product)<-[:CONTAINS]-(o:Order)
WITH p, count(o) AS orderCount
ORDER BY orderCount DESC
LIMIT 5
RETURN p.productName, orderCount
```

#### Example 3: Find Employees and Their Departments

```cypher
MATCH (e:Employee)-[:WORKS_IN]->(d:Department)
RETURN e.lastName, d.name
```
