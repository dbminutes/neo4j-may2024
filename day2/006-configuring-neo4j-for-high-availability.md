Here are some glossary terms related to clustering in Neo4j, which cover various aspects of its clustering architecture:

1. **Allocator** - Manages the allocation of databases to servers within the cluster based on specific topology constraints and strategies.
2. **Asynchronous Replication** - This is the replication method where data is replicated across nodes without immediate consistency guarantees, which allows for scalability.
3. **Availability** - Describes the ability of the database to be accessible for read-write or read-only operations, influenced by the cluster's fault tolerance.
4. **Bookmark** - A client-side marker used to ensure subsequent operations can see the effects of writes, ensuring read-your-own-writes consistency.
5. **Causal Clustering** - Neo4j's recommended clustering model that uses RAFT for managing cluster-wide consistency.
6. **Core Servers** - The main servers in a causal cluster that participate in the consensus and transaction commit process.
7. **Discovery** - Mechanisms that allow cluster members to find each other and communicate effectively.
8. **Election** - The process by which a new leader is chosen among the core servers in the cluster.
9. **Followers** - Nodes in a causal cluster that replicate data and may serve read requests but do not lead the cluster.
10. **Leader** - The core server in a causal cluster responsible for handling writes and coordination of replication.
11. **Read Replicas** - Cluster members that are not part of the core consensus group but can serve read-only queries to scale out the read capacity.
12. **Raft Log** - A log used by the RAFT consensus algorithm to keep track of commands and the state across cluster members.
13. **Transaction Log** - Logs that record all transactions processed by the database for durability and consistency.
14. **Multi-data center Routing** - Features that support routing queries and transactions to the most appropriate location in geographically distributed deployments.
15. **Reconciler** - A component involved in resolving data inconsistencies across cluster nodes to maintain data integrity and availability.
